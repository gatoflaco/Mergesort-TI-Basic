# Mergesort-TI-Basic
It's just mergesort, but I made it in my TI-83

To run this, first make sure you have an ₗFLAG variable, such that dim(ₗFLAG) is at least 1.
That is, if you don't have an ₗFLAG, run these commands at the main menu:
- SetUpEditor(ₗFLAG
- 1→dim(ₗFlag

You can find the SetUpEditor command in STAT->5.
2nd→STAT→OPS→B is where you can find the ₗ that lets you define custom named lists.
Use 2nd->ALPHA to A-LOCK and type out FLAG.
The → in the 1→dim(→FLAG command comes from the STO→ button.
You can find the dim command in 2nd→x⁻¹→MATH→3.

### The main program you execute is the MERGESRT program.
Assuming you have put these programs in your physical/emulated calculator already, go like this:
PRGM→[MERGESRT]
Since you may have other programs, MERGESRT is in brackets to represent that you should press what you have to to click it. You can use the arrow keys and ENTER if you have to.

Once you execute the program, you will be given an introductory message followed by a prompt for your list.
It says this in the program, but be aware that you MUST enter lists inside curly braces.

Once you enter your list, the program will begin outputting its process, to help indicate progress.
It outputs whatever its current left and right partitions look like, until the array is completely sorted, at which point it will output the final answer, clearly labeled as such.

The real question is, though, why are you trying to run this on your calculator?
